# Emotion-Classification
I have implimented CNN (convolution Neural Networks) model using tenserflow to classify your picture in 1 of the 6 emotion types (happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprise, ahegao)

## how to make it work
  - Download the repository in your main directory for jupyter notebooks
  - Download the dataset in the same above folder https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/emotion-recognition-dataset
  - run "jupyter notebook" and select the ipynb file named as "FacialExpressionRecognition.ipynb" and go through it
